put your whole code inside main() function that makes your code 20% faster.
sys.stdin is much faster than input especially in larger inputs.
use : "inp = sys.stdin.readline" then "inp().strip().split()" it's much faster than "sys.stdin.readline.strip().split()"
instead of printing each result individually, save them in list then print it.
if you can use the inputs without turning them into integers, do it, you will gain time by deleting map function.
